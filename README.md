1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here.

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 

I took alot of time to work on the project besides having previous experience in web development. I had to learn some new concepts. I also realized that in building such a game I should come up with concepts how I will use inorder to build it before implementation. 


3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

What if the game, could be made with only a framework such as React, what could be the advantages?

Can I make the buttons be movable by a user to wherever he/she wants?

Is there a quicker and better way to go about making the game?



4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

Building extra features was the most time-consuming part. In particular, adding syllables with varying frequencies to emulate the available pitches of real instruments. I researched a lot online and finally found the frequency of a real instrument as well as updating the frequency map and adding more buttons, I had to find additional color pairs (one light, one dark) for each of the newly added buttons. Because of my experience in mobile app design and knowledge of javascript, I'm confident in improving my web-design skills.
